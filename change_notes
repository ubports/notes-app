0.6.4
* solve visibility problems in portrait mode

Issues:
1. On some devices (i.e. BQ E5) in portrait mode one icon is not visible (edit-select-all button).
2. In landscape mode  some icons are on the left, some on the right.

Solution:
1. remove separators to free up some space
2. remove tick icon from close button to free up some space
3. reorder icons to be more intuitive

* UI match
swapped "edit" and "close" buttons in noteview.qml to match the new button layout in editnoteview.qml

* version update and solve clickable issue

1. raise version to 0.6.4 due to changes (manifest.json.in)
2. clickable threw error: sdk no longer an option --> sdk removed (clickable.json)
